 * @brief I/O Stream Abstraction
 * @author Haoran Luo
 *
 * This file abstracts stream for higher level of programming. The 
 * stream serves as interface for sending and receiving data.
 *
 * The constrains for streams are:
 * - Data read from the stream are removed from the stream permanently.
 * - Only when the data transmission is complete will the reading 
 *   or writing statement return.
 * - If an exception is thrown while reading or writing the stream,
 *   the stream status will become undefined therefore and the 
 *   program should close the stream since it always indicates 
 *   failure of reading or writing more data.
