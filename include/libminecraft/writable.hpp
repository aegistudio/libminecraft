 * @brief I/O Writable Interface
 * @author Haoran Luo
 *
 * This writable interface decorates descriptors that are capable
 * of being written to. This interface embeds a queue inside and 
 * when the write() operation cannot be completed instantly, the 
 * data to write will be stored in the queue.
 *
 * Thanks to the std::shared_ptr supporting customized destructor,
 * the user can broadcast a message and manage the buffer passed
 * in as they like.
 *
 * Please notice the writable class DOES NOT inherits from the 
 * descriptor's interface, to avoid DDoD multi-inheritance problem.
